\section{Introduction}
Datacenters see diverse network workloads with different objectives. Primarily, traffic can be classified into two kinds of flows: high-throughput flows (elephant) and low-throughput, latency-sensitive (mouse) flows. Many applications have a multi-layer partition/aggregate pattern workflow where a task at each layer is partitioned into multiple tasks and provided to the workers at the next level. To provide some guarantees, workers will typically be assigned tight deadlines. Network delays can lead to missed deadlines, causing deteriorated performance. Thus,
one of the key factors to application performance in datacenters is to provide low latency guarantees to the latency-sensitive flows.
