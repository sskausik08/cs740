\section{Experimental approach}
As far as our preliminary experimental approach, we will use the POX SDN controller and Mininet to emulate a datacenter network. One challenge we foresee is being able to generate a workload similar to a real-world data center. We plan to emulate a workload by sampling from a tail heavy distribution similar to the one described in \cite{dctcp}. We can use the Fat-Tree topology \cite{fattree} as a representative datacenter network with the hosts connected to the edges. We can also test our system in a real-world setting by setting up a small datacenter topology in Cloudlab and running it with network workloads to evaluate the performance of our system on a physical network.  The different axes of evaluation are as follows: latency suffered by the mice flows, size of queue buildup and performance of the system in terms of overhead of measurement, classification and scheduling.
